Get easy access to all your projects and manage them with project specific settings and options.

## Install
```
$Â apm install project-manager
```
You can also open Atom and go to Preferences > Install and search for `project-manager`


## Use
### List Projects
`ctrl-cmd-p` (mac) / `alt-shift-P` (win & linux) or `Project Manager: List Projects` in the Command Palette.

Projects can be filtered by `title`, `group` and `template` by typing `group: atom` which would give all projects with the `atom` group.


### Save Project
`Project Manager: Save Project` in the Command Palette and write the title you want to save the project as.

### Edit Project
`Project Manager: Edit Project` will open a page where you can edit the current project. It currently only supports certain fields.

### Edit Projects
All projects are saved in a `.cson` file which you can easily reach by searching for `Project Manager: Edit Projects` in the Command Palette.

## Project Settings

setting    | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                           | Default               
-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------
`title`    | `string`  | Projects title. Used in the projects list                                                                                                | `''`                  
`paths`    | `array`   | The folders that will open in the tree view. First path is the main one that counts as the project.                                                   | `[]`                  
`settings` | `Object`  | Enables you to set project specific settings. Everything that goes in the `config.cson` file can go here. It also supports scoped settings.           | `{}`                  
`icon`     | `string`  | Icon that shows in the projects list. It's class-based so can either be a class already provided by Atom like `icon-squirrel` or a class of your own. You can find a list of all icons on [octicons.github.com](https://octicons.github.com/). | `'icon-chevron-right'`
`devMode`  | `boolean` | `true` if project should open in dev mode. [Look here][devMode] for more info.                                                                        | `false`               
`group`    | `string`  | Adds a group to the projects list that can be used to group and filter projects                                                                       | `null`                
`template` | `string`  | If you add a project in the `projects.cson` file without `paths` it will count as a template. This way you can easily share settings between projects | `null`                

### Local settings file
All these settings can be added to a `project.cson` file in the root folder of the project. It follows the below example, but without the array.

### Example
```coffeescript
[
  {
    title: 'Project Manager'
    group: 'Atom'
    paths: [
      '/path/to/project-manager'
    ]
    devMode: true
    settings:
      'editor.tabLength': 4
      'editor.showInvisibles': true
  }
]

```

## Provider
If you want to use the projects available through the Project Manager you can use the provided methods.

```javascript
function consumeProjectManager({ getProjects, getProject, saveProject, openProject } => {
  /**
   * Get an array containing all projects.
   * The callback will be run each time a project is added.
   */
  getProjects(projects => {
    // Do something with the projects.
  });

  /**
   * Get the currently active project.
   * The callback will be run whenever the active project changes.
   */
  getProject(project => {
    if (project) {
      // We have an active project.
    } else {
      // Project is either not loaded yet, or there is no project saved.
    }
  });

  /**
   * Can take either a project recieved from getProjects/getProject or
   * just an object with the props for a new project.
   */
  saveProject(project);

  /**
   * Will open the project.
   * `openInSameWindow` should be true if the project should open up in the
   * current window.
   */
  openProject(project, openInSameWindow);
});

```
