# Changelog

## 1.6
- Project path now shows when saving a project

## 1.5
This update adds an option for **environment specific project** files which are based on your hostname to be able to sync the atom folder between environments without ignoring `projects.cson`.
Enabling this option will create a `projects.hostname.cson` file.

After enabling this option you will have to manually move the contents of `projects.cson` to the new `projects.environment.cson` file. After this `projects.cson`can be delete or left alone.

## 1.4
- Added option to sort by title.
- Added changelog
